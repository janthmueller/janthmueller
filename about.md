# About Me
My name is Jan, and I am passionate about automation through software solutions. With a background in computer vision and a keen interest in AI-based technologies, I strive to create efficient and impactful systems.

Currently, I work as a Research Associate, focusing on multi-object tracking and neural network compression. Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, staying active through fitness, and discussing philosophical ideas with friends.
